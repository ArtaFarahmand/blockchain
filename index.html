        <p>The layout of the energy industry is going through a fundamental change as part of a structural transition [1]. Global support for electricity generation through renewable energy with focus on solar and wind is leading to structural changes in energy supply and distribution [8]. The increasingly distributed nature of electricity generation calls for intelligent connection among.</p>

         <p>Asset intensive oil and gas industry with $700 billion annual expenditure in capital investments is a top candidate to benefit from the value generated through technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), estimated at $370 billion additional revenue globally by 2020 [9]. However, the data-intensive nature of IoT technology calls for data transformation in the industry [2].</p>

        <p>In recent years, blockchain technology has been advanced as a platform that enables intelligent interaction among distributed energy suppliers and consumers [7]. Blockchain could also be the vessel to carry data transformation in the oil and gas industry [2].
  The question to ask is how energy industry can prepare for blockchain?</p>

        In is important to be mindful that applications developed based on blockchain technology will not only interface with the physical infrastructure in the energy sector, but also with the governing and regulatory framework of the industry. Designers must pay attention to industry specific and ubiquitous regulatory considerations which may vary under different jurisdictions [11].

        <p>Blockchain can improve customer experience, increase profitability, and reduce complexity in energy sector [11].</p>
        <p>One of the strongest applications of blockchain in oil and gas industry is energy trading. Blockchain technology provides a reliable and efficient platform for trading energy by executing the transaction through smart contracts and recording on a digital, distributed ledger that can provide synchronized and simultaneous access to information [4].</p>
        <p>In addition to energy trading, blockchain can be implemented to enhance asset management in oil and gas industry [11].</p>
        <p>In the coming years, blockchain application can be integrated with other emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent sensors, and smart contracts to transform market structure and user engagement in the energy sector [11]. </p>
